Users highlight the unique features and benefits of GPT-4o, such as its tone, reasoning style, and consistency, which were crucial for their work, creativity, and well-being. The sudden removal of GPT-4o without offering it as a legacy option has caused significant disruption, especially for those who relied on it for therapeutic support, writing, and other critical tasks.
