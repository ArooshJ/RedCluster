0,"Users are concerned about the removal of Standard Voice Mode and its replacement with Advanced Voice Mode, seeking to retain the former for its natural warmth and functionality.",Voice Mode,"The topic 'Voice Mode' best captures the essence of the debate between standard and advanced voice modes, reflecting user concerns and preferences.","The cluster revolves around user dissatisfaction with the Advanced Voice Mode (AVM) and the potential removal of Standard Voice Mode (SVM). Users praise SVM for its natural tone, consistency, and emotional resonance, which they feel is lacking in AVM. The primary concern is that AVM does not adequately replace SVM, leading to a loss of functionality and user attachment. Users request that both modes be maintained or that AVM be significantly improved to match the qualities of SVM."
1,GPT-5 Underperforms,GPT-5 Performance Issues,"The best fit topic name is 'GPT-5 Performance Issues' because it encapsulates the overarching concern with GPT-5's degraded performance, particularly in areas like image generation and output quality.","The cluster analysis indicates a significant concern with GPT-5's performance, particularly in image generation and output quality. Users have expressed frustration with GPT-5's inability to handle tasks effectively, such as reading project files, generating images, and providing accurate code. The evidence sets and sample comments highlight a regression in GPT-5's capabilities compared to its predecessors like GPT-4o. The master topic 'GPT-5 Underperforms' captures the essence of user dissatisfaction and perceived downgrade in GPT-5's performance."
2,Users are frustrated with the removal of the GPT-4o model and request its return or the option to choose between models.,GPT-4o Model Removal and Restoration,The topic best fits the evidence as it directly relates to user comments about the removal and desired restoration of the GPT-4o model.,The cluster revolves around users' dissatisfaction with the removal of the GPT-4o model and their desire for more model choices or the restoration of previous models. Users comment on the superiority of GPT-4o over GPT-5 and request options to use legacy models.
3,The removal of OpenAI's GPT-4o model and its impact on users,OpenAI GPT-4o Model,"The topic 'OpenAI GPT-4o Model' is the best fit as it directly relates to the central theme of the evidence, which is the removal and impact of the GPT-4o model.","The cluster revolves around the removal of OpenAI's GPT-4o model and its significant impact on users who relied on it for various purposes, including therapeutic support, creative writing, and workflow continuity. The evidence highlights a strong emotional response from the community, with many users feeling that the new GPT-5 model does not adequately replace the unique qualities of GPT-4o. The topic is highly relevant as it touches on user safety, trust, and the value of model choice."
4,Moderation and Censorship Concerns,Moderation Issues,"The topic 'Moderation Issues' best captures the essence of the cluster, which revolves around user frustration with perceived censorship and moderation practices.","Based on the evidence and sample comments, the cluster appears to be centered around user frustration with what they perceive as inadequate moderation and censorship. Users express concerns about ignored feedback, perceived censorship, and the handling of comments and responses during an AMA session. The topics and keywords consistently point towards issues related to moderation practices and user engagement."
5,ChatGPT Context Window Limitation Frustration,Context Window Limitation,The best fit topic is 'Context Window Limitation' as it accurately reflects the core pain point expressed by users regarding the limited context window of ChatGPT.,"The cluster is based on user frustration with the limited context window of ChatGPT, particularly the 32k limit for non-Pro plans. Users are unhappy with the current limitations and are comparing it to competitors like Google Gemini, which offers larger context windows. The users are requesting larger context windows, at least 128k or preferably 1 million tokens, to be able to use ChatGPT for serious text processing and coding tasks."
6,"Users are upset about the discontinuation of GPT-4o and legacy models, seeking their return for their unique qualities like personality and companionship.",Users Want GPT-4o Back,The best-fit topic name is justified by the prevalence of user comments and model topics directly referencing the desire for GPT-4o and dissatisfaction with the current GPT-5 model.,"The cluster revolves around users expressing disappointment and frustration over the discontinuation of GPT-4o and other legacy models. They miss the personality, companionship, and specific functionalities these models provided. Users compare the new GPT-5 model unfavorably, citing its lack of warmth, empathy, and 'charm'. The comments reflect a strong desire for the return of these legacy models, with some users even considering switching to alternative AI services."
7,"Users are concerned about the removal of GPT-4o and its emotional tone, which provided a unique and valuable experience for those seeking emotional support and connection.",GPT-4o Emotional Tone,"The topic 'GPT-4o Emotional Tone' best fits the evidence as it consistently appears across different models and evidence sets, highlighting the emotional connection users had with GPT-4o.","The cluster analysis reveals that users highly value the emotional intelligence and tone of GPT-4o, which was abruptly removed in favor of GPT-5. Users express a strong desire for the return of GPT-4o or the option to choose it, citing its irreplaceable emotional support and connection. The analysis underscores the importance of emotional resonance in AI interactions and the need for users to have choices that cater to their diverse emotional needs."
8,Overly Strict Content Censorship in ChatGPT,Harmful Sexual Content Filtering,"This topic best fits the evidence as it directly addresses the concerns about filtering harmful sexual content in ChatGPT, which is a recurring theme across the evidence sets.","The cluster is based on concerns about overly strict content censorship in ChatGPT, particularly regarding harmful sexual content. Users feel that the current filtering system is too sensitive and hinders legitimate use, such as learning about history or engaging in creative writing. There is a strong desire for more nuanced filtering that can distinguish between harmful content and legitimate discussions."
9,"Trust, Safety, and Ethics in AI Systems",AI Safety and User Trust,"The topic 'AI Safety and User Trust' best fits as the central theme across all evidence sets, addressing both safety concerns and the importance of trust in AI systems.","The cluster revolves around concerns and discussions about AI safety, user trust, and ethical implications of AI systems, particularly focusing on OpenAI's approaches and user experiences."
